# Ansible Provisioning and Deployment

Petclinic provisioning and deployment with Ansible.

## Notes

### Inventory

The inventory points to an IP address (on my machine) of a Vagrant box.
Specifically, `vagrant-ssh` found in [savishy/vagrant-boxes](http://github.com/savishy/vagrant-boxes).

The inventory simulates a typical bare-metal infrastructure with a static IP address. Modify it as needed.
